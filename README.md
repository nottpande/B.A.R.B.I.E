# B.A.R.B.I.E: Brilliant Artificial Response-Based Interactive Entity

**B.A.R.B.I.E** is a voice assistant designed to empower Kannada-speaking individuals, especially those in the villages of Karnataka who face challenges interacting with smartphones and computers due to language barriers. B.A.R.B.I.E aims to provide these users with equal access to the resources that technology offers in today's world.

## Motivation and Vision

In many parts of Karnataka, particularly in rural areas, people often struggle with technology because they do not speak English. This issue is especially prevalent among the elderly and those who are literate only in Kannada. Our vision is to create a portal through B.A.R.B.I.E that enables these individuals to interact with technology in their native language, thus ensuring they have equal opportunities to benefit from the advancements in the digital age.

## How B.A.R.B.I.E Works

1. **Speech Recognition (ASR)**:
   - The user's Kannada speech is captured and converted into text using an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model, specifically trained to understand Kannada speech patterns.

2. **Language Translation**:
   - The recognized Kannada text is translated into English using a machine translation model. This allows the assistant to interface with a broader range of applications and APIs that typically operate in English.

3. **Natural Language Understanding**:
   - The translated English text is processed by a Large Language Model (LLM) API, which interprets the user's request or query and generates an appropriate response in text format.

4. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**:
   - The generated English response is translated back into Kannada(again using a Language Translation model) and converted into speech using a text-to-speech (TTS) model, ensuring the assistant communicates in the user's preferred language.

5. **Execution**:
   - B.A.R.B.I.E executes the required task or delivers the response, ensuring a seamless interaction in Kannada.
